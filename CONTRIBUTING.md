# Contributing to uplnk

uplnk is Apache 2.0 licensed and uses a [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/). By submitting a pull request you certify that you have the right to contribute the code under those terms. Sign off each commit with `git commit -s`.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Minimum version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Bun | 1.1.30 | Install with `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install \| bash`, check with `bun --version` |
| pnpm | 9 | `bun install -g pnpm` (or `npm install -g pnpm`) |
| Ollama | any | [ollama.com](https://ollama.com) — needed to run the app locally |

The repo uses pnpm workspaces for install + dependency resolution. Do not use `npm` or `yarn` — lockfile conflicts will block CI. Application runtime, dev server, and tests all run under Bun (`bun:sqlite` is the only SQLite driver). Node.js is not required for development.

---

## Dev setup

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/thepixelabs/uplnk.git
cd uplnk

# 2. Install dependencies (all packages)
pnpm install

# 3. Start Ollama (in a separate terminal if not running as a service)
ollama serve
ollama pull llama3.2

# 4. Run the app in dev mode
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm dev` runs `bun bin/uplnk.ts` inside `packages/app` — Bun executes TypeScript directly with no build step. Changes to source files take effect on the next invocation.

To run with specific flags:

```bash
pnpm --filter uplnk dev -- --model qwen2.5-coder:7b --theme light
```

The dependency direction is strictly: `app` → `db`, `app` → `shared`, `db` → `shared`. `shared` has no internal dependencies.

## Running tests

```bash
# All packages, single run
pnpm test

# Watch mode (reruns on file changes)
pnpm test:watch

# Specific package
pnpm --filter uplnk test
```

Tests use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/). Unit tests live alongside source files in `__tests__/` subdirectories (e.g., `packages/app/src/lib/__tests__/`). Integration tests use a separate config (`vitest.integration.config.ts`) and are not run in CI by default — run them manually before submitting changes to streaming or MCP code.

Type-checking runs separately from tests:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
```

## Commit message format

uplnk uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

[optional body]

[optional footer — include Signed-off-by here]
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`

**Scopes:** `app`, `db`, `shared`, `mcp`, `streaming`, `config`, `doctor`, `ci`

Examples:

```
feat(streaming): add 33ms flush interval to reduce React reconciler work
fix(mcp): respect allowedPaths when listing directories recursively
docs(readme): add keyboard shortcut table
chore(deps): upgrade drizzle-orm to 0.45.0
```

Keep the summary line under 72 characters. Use the body to explain *why*, not *what* — the diff shows what changed.

## PR process

1. **Open an issue first** for anything non-trivial. Describe the problem and proposed approach before writing code. This avoids wasted effort.

2. **Branch from `main`:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Keep PRs small and focused.** One logical change per PR. If your change touches both the streaming layer and the UI, split it into two PRs.

4. **Before submitting:**
   ```bash
   pnpm typecheck   # must pass with zero errors
   pnpm lint        # must pass with zero errors
   pnpm test        # all tests must pass
   uplnk doctor     # must show all checks green on your machine
   ```

5. **Fill in the PR template.** Describe what changed, why, and how you tested it. Include a short terminal recording or screenshot for UI changes.

6. **Sign your commits:**
   ```bash
   git commit -s -m "feat(app): your change"
   ```

7. A maintainer will review within a few business days. Expect feedback. Address comments with new commits — do not force-push during review.

## Reporting bugs

Open a GitHub issue. Include:

- Output of `uplnk doctor`
- Output of `uplnk --version`
- Your OS and terminal emulator
- Steps to reproduce
- Contents of `/tmp/uplnk-crash.log` (if a crash occurred)

Do not include API keys, file contents with sensitive data, or private conversation history in issue reports.
